## CNN Model 
# Instalation 
1. Python Environment Setup: Ensure Python is installed.
2. pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
# Usage

# Data Preparation
1. Dataset: Place your gym equipment images in the  directory.
2. Data Splitting: The script will automatically split the data into training and validation sets (80:20 ratio).

# Model Training
1. Neural Network Model: The script uses Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 for classification.
2. Training: Execute the script to train the model
3. Model Saving: The trained model will be saved as model.h5.

# Replication Steps
