## CNN Model 
# Required Libraries
The necessary libraries for running the gym equipment image classifier script are:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. tensorflow
5. matplotlib

# Instalation 
1. Python Environment Setup: Ensure Python is installed.
2. Library Installation: Open the terminal or command prompt and execute the following command: 
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

# Usage

# Data Preparation
1. Dataset: Place your gym equipment images in the  directory.
2. Data Splitting: The script will automatically split the data into training and validation sets (80:20 ratio).

# Model Training
1. Neural Network Model: The script uses Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 for classification.
2. Training: Execute the script to train the model
3. Model Saving: The trained model will be saved as model.h5.

# Replication Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Fitmate-capstone/ML_Model_Development/tree/main
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Place your gym equipment images datasets in the specified directory.
4. Run the Python script for training and evaluation.
